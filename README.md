# 📖 Overview

InsightIQ is an AI-powered Chrome Extension that transforms everyday web browsing into an intelligent, interactive experience.

Instead of switching between browser tabs and AI chat applications, users can communicate directly with the webpage they are currently viewing.

The extension understands page context, answers questions, summarizes content, extracts key insights, analyzes uploaded files, performs safe browser actions, and generates AI-powered images—all within a modern browser interface.

Designed for students, developers, researchers, and professionals, InsightIQ streamlines learning, research, and productivity without disrupting the browsing workflow.

---

# ❓ Why InsightIQ?

Traditional AI workflows require users to:

- Copy webpage content
- Switch to another AI application
- Paste content
- Ask questions
- Return to the browser

InsightIQ eliminates this entire workflow by bringing AI directly into the browser.

Users remain focused on their work while receiving intelligent, context-aware assistance exactly where they need it.

# 🏆 OpenAI Build Week Submission

InsightIQ was created as part of **OpenAI Build Week 2026**, where developers were challenged to build real-world AI applications using modern AI tools.

The goal of this project was to rethink how people interact with web content by bringing contextual AI directly into the browser instead of forcing users to switch between webpages and external AI chat applications.

InsightIQ demonstrates how AI can become a natural part of everyday browsing while maintaining user control, privacy, and productivity.
